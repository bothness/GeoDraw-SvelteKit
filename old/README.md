The CensusAPI does not want to run over https, so this must be used locally. Once fixed this shold be available 
https://wolfiex.github.io/GeoDraw-SvelteKit/public/index.html



^^ API WORKS OVER LOCALHOST ONLY ^^


## to run locally 
- `git clone https://wolfiex.github.io/GeoDraw-SvelteKit/public/index.html` and cd into the directory 
- `npm i `
- `npm run dev`
